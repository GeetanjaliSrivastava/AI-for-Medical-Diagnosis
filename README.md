# AI-for-Medical-Diagnosis
AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments.
In this assignment I have explored medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras.
The assignment will walk through some of the steps of building and evaluating this deep learning classifier model. 
In particular:
Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset.
Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification.
Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.
Visualize model activity using GradCAMs.
